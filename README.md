# About Me
👋 Hi, I’m @oGeorge88
👀 I’m interested in web development, particularly in front-end technologies and creating seamless user experiences.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js, as well as back-end technologies like Node.js and Express.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that focus on web development, UI/UX design, and improving accessibility on the web.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I love photography, computer works, hardware and often combine my skills in web development with my passion for creating visually stunning web pages using my own photos!
