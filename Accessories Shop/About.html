    <h2>Understanding VAT Calculation</h2>
    <p>When purchasing accessories, it's important to understand the cost breakdown. We use a Value Added Tax (VAT) system to ensure transparency in pricing.</p>
    <p><strong>Gross Price:</strong> This is the total price you pay for an accessory, including VAT.</p>
    <p><strong>VAT:</strong> The tax amount calculated based on a percentage of the net price. Our standard VAT rate is 7%.</p>
    <p><strong>Net Price:</strong> The price of the accessory before VAT is added. You can calculate it using the formula:</p>
    <p>Net Price = Gross Price / (1 + VAT Rate)</p>
    <p>For example, if an accessory costs 100 BAHT (Gross Price) and the VAT rate is 7%, the Net Price and VAT amount are calculated as follows:</p>
    <p>VAT Amount = Gross Price / (100 + VAT Rate) * VAT Rate</p>
    <p>Net Price = Gross Price - VAT Amount</p>
